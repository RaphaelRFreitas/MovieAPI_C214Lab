# Movies API
This is a simple movies API built using FastAPI and MongoDB. The API allows you to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) movie information in a MongoDB database.

## Installation
To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
pip install requirements.txt
```
## Running the API
To start the API server, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
uvicorn app.src.movies_api:app --reload
```
This will start the API server on port 8000.

## Testing the API
You can test the API using a tool like Postman or by using the command line with the pytest utility.
```bash
pytest
```

## Conclusion
With these basic instructions, you should be ready to start using the movies API. Remember that you can customize the API and add additional features, such as user authentication and input validation, as needed.
